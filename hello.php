Plugin Name: Hello Designer
Plugin URI: https://wordpress.org/plugins/hello-designer/
Description: Instead of the hope of a generation that few developers are alive to remember, we've modified the classic Wordpress plugin to provide some tangible help to Wordpress users the world over: design inspiration. Quotes from famous designers will help you whenever you get stuck, and failing that, will hopefully at least provide a little distraction.
